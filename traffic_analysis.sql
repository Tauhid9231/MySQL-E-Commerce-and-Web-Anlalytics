/********************************** MAVEN E-COMMERCE & WEB ANALYTICS: TRAFFIC SOURCE ANALYSIS *******************************/

-- In the very first section, we'll be analysing the utm_parameters and session-to-order conversion rate to identify the
-- most effective and efficient marketign channels. 
-- The goal is to achieve maximum session volume without over-spending on ads.
-- Thus, this analysis will help identify opportunities to eliminate wasted spend and scale high-converting traffic
